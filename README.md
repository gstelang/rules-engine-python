# Description 

* The purpose of this question - is go over the scenario of reviewing of a pull request submitted by your less experienced colleague.

* As you may notice, the pull request has some room for improvement. Please identify all areas that you would want to discuss and make sure that you can explain which ones are more important than the others.

* Have a look at the following files:

pr_description.md - this is what you would typically see in a pull request in GitHub (or any similar service).
rules_engine.py - implements the core logic.
tests/test.py - as the name suggests, this is the testing module. These are the tests submitted in the PR and require review as well. We may use the tests to make sure that changes that we may make don't break the logic. If we need to implement new tests - we are going to do it in this file too.
